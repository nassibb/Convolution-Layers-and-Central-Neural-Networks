## Foundations of Neural Networks and Convolutional Learning
This project covers neural network learning, parameter optimization using cross entropy loss, gradient descent,and automatic differentiation. It further investigates convolutional architectures that uses local connectivity and parameter sharing to detect spatial features in images.  ￼

By integrating convolutional layers, pooling operations, and fully connected networks, the model demonstrates deep learning systems progressively transforming low-level pixel data into high-level representations suitable for classification tasks.
